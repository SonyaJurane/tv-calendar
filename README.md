# tv-calendar
TV calendar is a web application that creates a custom schedule of TV show releases based on userâ€™s watch history.

Do you watch multiple TV shows with several seasons and are tired of keeping up with the release dates? Do you hate constantly googling "When is ____ coming out?" and then proceeding to forget and google it all over again?

Don't worry - **TV Calendar** was created exactly for that!

Just add the shows you're watching and **TV Calendar** will generate a custom calendar with future episode releases! To save the results, create an account so the information is safely stored in the database. Want to be reminded before a new episode or a season is about to come out? Enable email notifications and **TV Calendar** will send you an email a couple of days before you need to tune in!
